# DataStructures-Algorithms
 Projects taking into account sorting, searching, algorithms and object oriented programming
 
## Algorithms Explored
| Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Bubble Sort  | Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed |
| Selection Sort | An effective and efficient sort algorithm based on comparison operations. It adds one element in each iteration. You need to select the smallest element in the array and move it to the beginning of the array by swapping with the front element. |
| Insertion Sort | Simple sorting algorithm that works similarly to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. |
| Merge Sort | Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. |
| Linear Search | Linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. |
| Binary Search | Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. |

## Tick-Tack-Toe Project
A project coded to emulate the classic tick tack toe game where the end user plays matches against a min-max algorithm
