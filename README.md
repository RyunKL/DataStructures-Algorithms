 Projects taking into account sorting, searching, algorithms and object oriented programming
 
## Algorithms Explored
| Project Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Bubble Sort  | Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed |
| Selection Sort | An effective and efficient sort algorithm based on comparison operations. It adds one element in each iteration. You need to select the smallest element in the array and move it to the beginning of the array by swapping with the front element. |
| Insertion Sort | Simple sorting algorithm that works similarly to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. |
| Merge Sort | Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. |
